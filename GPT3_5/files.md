The code generates four primary outputs to analyze the Prisoner's Dilemma strategies:

### 1. **strat_log.txt**
This log file records the outcomes of each game iteration, detailing the actions chosen by both agents and their corresponding scores. It provides a turn-by-turn account of the simulation, highlighting how each strategy responds to different situations and the impact of those decisions on the overall score.

### 2. **llm_log.txt**
Focuses on the language model (LLM) responses, capturing the decision-making process of Agent B when it's powered by an LLM. This log gives insights into the LLM's strategy, offering a peek into its rationale or lack thereof, and how it interprets the game's dynamics.

### 3. **strat_desc.txt**
Contains detailed descriptions of the strategies employed during the simulation, as interpreted by the LLM or defined by the simulation's parameters. It aims to shed light on the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of each strategy within the Prisoner's Dilemma context.

### 4. **strat_score.csv**
A summary file that tabulates the final scores of Agents A and B across various strategies after numerous iterations. It serves as a quantitative measure of each strategy's effectiveness, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of performance outcomes.

Together, these files provide a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing the dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma, blending qualitative insights with quantitative data to deepen understanding and inform strategy development.
